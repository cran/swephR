Description: The Swiss Ephemeris (version 2.10.03) is a high precision ephemeris based upon the
    DE431 ephemerides from NASA's JPL. It covers the time range 13201 BCE to
    17191 CE. This package uses the semi-analytic theory by Steve Moshier.
    For faster and more accurate calculations, the compressed Swiss Ephemeris
    data is available in the 'swephRdata' package. To access this data package,
    run 'install.packages("swephRdata", repos = "https://rstub.r-universe.dev",
    type = "source")'. The size of the 'swephRdata' package is approximately
    115 MB. The user can also use the original JPL DE431 data.
